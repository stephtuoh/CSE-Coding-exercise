CSE Coding exercise - Junior Software Engineer vacancy – assessment task for selected applicants

# Task
The task is to model a supermarket pricing calculator in software. This is inspired by PragDave’s
Supermarket Kata.
I will write a program which works out how to price a shopping basket, allowing for
different pricing structures including:
• Three tins of beans for the price of two
• Onions for 29p / kg
• Two cans of coca-cola for £1
• Any 3 ales from the set {...} for £6
