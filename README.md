CSE Coding exercise - Junior Software Engineer vacancy – assessment task for selected applicants

### Description
This repo contains the file Supermarket pricing calculator.py written by Stephanie Tuohey. The code is designed to meet the requirements outlined below. It will:
- Display a list of available items in the supermarket. The user can change or add to this list in section 1.
- Each item can either have a price in £s or be priced by the weight.
- Items not priced by weight may be included in a deal. There are three types of deal which can be seen/modified in section 2 of the code.
- The user can input as many available items as they want. Some require you to also input the weight.
- Once all items are added the receipt will be generated, automaticallyshowing any savings from deals.


### Task
The task is to model a supermarket pricing calculator in software. This is inspired by PragDave’s
Supermarket Kata.
I will write a program which works out how to price a shopping basket, allowing for
different pricing structures including:
- Three tins of beans for the price of two
- Onions for 29p / kg
- Two cans of coca-cola for £1
- Any 3 ales from the set {...} for £6

### Notes
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Install the required Python library, Pandas
- Items priced by weight (e.g., Oranges, Onions) require you to input the weight in kg.
- The script currently handles three types of discounts, but you can easily extend it with more complex deals or different pricing strategies.

### Future improvements
- Ensure that items priced by weight can't be added to deals
- Allow adding items in bulk
- Dropdown of available items to select instead of typing in input
